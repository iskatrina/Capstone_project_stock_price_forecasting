# Capstone project: Stock price forecasting


## Overview

This project is part of Udacity Data Science project + some additions which I used or plan to use in the project to accompany it for further development . 
Project offers few models which could be used to predict Stock prices for number of Stock choosen for Portfolio. Each model shows its accuracy in each case.
Using Stock price forecast , could be developed strategy for Buy/Sell the Stock for possible profit. 



Content

The project is divided into three components:

- Data retrieval 
- Feature engeneering 
- Choosing Stocks to build Portfolio
- Optimize Porfolio. Define Optimal Risky Portfolio
- ML model using DeepLearning LSTM
- ML model using Random Forest
- ML model using SARIMA 
- Interactive application using Dash

## Instructions

- Run the Dashapp_1.py
- choose Stock name, model which you would like to use,  date range for prediction (1 day, 2,3,..30 days)
- Press Predict button.

PS. in case of LSTM Deep learning model, you need to wait to allow model retrain data according to choosen time period
